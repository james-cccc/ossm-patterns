This project is a work in progres but is striving to provide example service mesh configurations. 

Initial security conscious design: [Service Mesh Control Plane Architectural Decisions](defaultmesh/instance/base#readme)

## Requirements

The following has been tested on OSSM 2.2.2, a gitops deployment of the mesh is only capable in this version due to [OSSM-1718 - Istio Operator pauses reconciliation when gateway deployed to non-control plane namespace](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-1718).
